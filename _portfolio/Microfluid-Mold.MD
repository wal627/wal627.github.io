# Project Description

The overall goal for this project was to experiment with two new 3D modeling technologies: generative design and stress testing. Generative design is a process that entails creating a bare-bones model of only the most crucial 

# Desiging the Deck 
The rationale for the design was simple; The phone would be clamped in place by a clip and threaded gear, and that assembly would then be placed on a lockable ball-and-socket to offer as many degrees of freedom as possible. The cap of the ball-and-socket is also threaded and can be clamped down to lock the joint into place. Finally, the whole assembly attaches to standard 25mm bike handlebars using heated inserts and M5 screws. Combining the phone clamp, ball-and-socket, and bike clamp, I was able to successfully achieve a phone holder that can fit almost any phone, hold the phone at any reasonable angle, and attach to all standard bike handlebars. I chose to print my phone holder out of PLA for its rigidity, cheap cost, and UV resistance compared to ABS. While materials like carbon fiber were available, these exotic materials can be difficult and unreliable to print, as well as expensive.

# Assembly

There are seven total parts to the phone holder. To assemble it completely, one must first set the M5 heat inserts into the bottom handlebar piece. Then, the bottom of the ball joint socket can be attached to the bike frame with standard M5 screws. The ball piece then can be set in place in the ball joint socket using the joint cap, and the main phone mount can be screwed on top of the joint. Finally, the clip can be placed on the phone mount and the large gear screwed on over top to clamp down onto the phone.
