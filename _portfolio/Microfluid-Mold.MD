# Project Description

The goal of this project is to homogenize two fluids. 

# Slide Fabrication Process



# Desigin Rationale 
The homogenizer contains three separate obstacles each connected by a small channel. The first obstacle is a series of zigzags which serve as a preliminary mixing channel without creating much resistance in the flow of the fluid. The next obstacle contains an array of walls that continually change the flow rate and direction of the fluids to promote homogeneity. The last obstacle is a series of ramps that ensure the fluid is mixed in the z-direction as this is the only three-dimensional obstacle.

# Assembly

There are seven total parts to the phone holder. To assemble it completely, one must first set the M5 heat inserts into the bottom handlebar piece. Then, the bottom of the ball joint socket can be attached to the bike frame with standard M5 screws. The ball piece then can be set in place in the ball joint socket using the joint cap, and the main phone mount can be screwed on top of the joint. Finally, the clip can be placed on the phone mount and the large gear screwed on over top to clamp down onto the phone.
