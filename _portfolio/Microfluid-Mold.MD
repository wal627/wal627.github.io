## Project Description

The goal of this project was to homogenize two fluids. This was done by 3D modeling three different mixing obstacles for the fluids to pass through. This design was then SLA-printed out of resin and used as a mold for a PDMS cast. Finally, the homogenizer was tested by pumping two different colored fluids into it and observing the color change of the outputted fluid.

## Slide Fabrication Process

1. Print and Cure Mold:
Begin by 3D printing the microfluidic mold using SLA technology. Ensure that the printed mold accurately represents the desired microfluidic channels and features. After printing, cure the mold according to the material specifications to achieve optimal mechanical properties.

2. Parylene Coating:
Apply a Parylene coating to the cured mold. Parylene is a thin, conformal coating that enhances the surface properties of the mold, providing increased biocompatibility and chemical resistance. This step is crucial for ensuring the integrity and performance of the microfluidic device.

3. Cast PDMS:
Prepare a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mixture and cast it onto the Parylene-coated mold. PDMS is a widely used elastomer in microfluidics due to its transparency, flexibility, and biocompatibility. Allow the PDMS to cure and form a solid layer, taking the shape of the microfluidic channels within the mold.

4. Plasma Bond Glass Slide:
Plasma treat a glass slide to activate its surface, improving adhesion. Place the activated glass slide on top of the cured PDMS layer. The plasma treatment enhances the bonding between the glass and PDMS, creating a sealed microfluidic structure. This step completes the assembly of the microfluidic device.

## Design Rationale 
The homogenizer contains three separate obstacles each connected by a small channel. The first obstacle is a series of zigzags which serve as a preliminary mixing channel without creating much resistance in the flow of the fluid. The next obstacle contains an array of walls that continually change the flow rate and direction of the fluids to promote homogeneity. The last obstacle is a series of ramps that ensure the fluid is mixed in the z-direction as this is the only three-dimensional obstacle.
